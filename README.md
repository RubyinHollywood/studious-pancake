# Ruby in Hollywood battlesnake-ruby

A starter kit for the [BattleSnake AI challenge](https://www.meetup.com/rubyinhollywood/events/nmzckpyxfbcc/).


`script/bootstrap` should install any dependencies and register you with our local [Battlesnake server](http://battlesnake.local)

`script/snake` should run your snake 🐍 and be ready for battle.

When you see some other snakes you want to duke it out with run `script/battle-with`, like:

```shell
./script/battle-with jake=http://10.0.1.25:9292 jp=http://10.0.1.27:9292 joe=http://10.0.1.19:9292 colleen=http://10.0.1.10:9292
```

to get that game started.


See [these docs](https://github.com/sendwithus/battlesnake-server#competitors-guide) for the rules of the game.


Since we're short on time, we've provided a starting Snake class which should avoid hitting itself and walls and allow
you to focus on your Snake crafting. Feel free to use it or toss it!
