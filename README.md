# Ruby in Hollywood battlesnake-ruby

A starter kit for the [BattleSnake AI challenge](https://www.meetup.com/rubyinhollywood/events/nmzckpyxfbcc/).


`script/bootstrap` should install any dependencies and register you with our local [Battlesnake server](http://battlesnake.local)

`script/snake` should run your snake 🐍 and be ready for battle.


See [these docs](https://github.com/sendwithus/battlesnake-server#competitors-guide) for the rules of the game.


Since we're short on time, we've provided a starting Snake class which should avoid hitting itself and walls and allow
you to focus on your Snake crafting. Feel free to use it or toss it!
